# Cleaning_data
Coursera (GaCD) assignment

File run_analysis.R is the result of the assignment of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data by John Hopkins University, that is also part of Data Science Specialization.
As the name suggests, the aim of the assignment was to download a file which contained untidy and big dataset.
My task was to filter the dataset and create a new cleaner and smaller one according to this criteria:

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set (Create a one data set except of two).
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (Filter from all the variables only mean and std).
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (Filter labels).
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names (Label the variables appropriately).
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (Create a new smaller dataset from bigger existing one).
